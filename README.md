# Form a Story
## Exercise by Codecademy to practise form validation.
### Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. For this project, weâ€™ll use our knowledge of the HTML <form> and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!
### What you have to do is now make a <form> capable of collecting the correct information so that the newly crafted story makes sense!
#### Exercise provided by Codecademy. The logic for parsing and inserting of user inputs was already taken care of in main.js using JavaScript. Codecademy also added some styling to the page in style.css.
